Welcome to the Block Knock Game! This physics-based game challenges players to knock over blocks by launching balls at them. Aim carefully and manage your launch power to score points and progress through levels.

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Launch the game from the main menu by clicking on the "Start" button.
- **Aim**: Move your mouse to aim the camera. The direction you're facing will determine the trajectory of your ball launch.
- **Adjust Launch Power**: Press and hold the left mouse button to start charging your launch power. The power will oscillate between minimum and maximum values; release the button to launch the ball with the current power.
- **Launch the Ball**: Release the left mouse button to launch the ball towards the blocks. The goal is to knock as many blocks off the pedestal as possible.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on the number of blocks knocked off the pedestal. The game tracks your score, displaying it on the screen.
- **Reset**: Press the 'R' key at any time to reset the current level and try again.

## Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Aim the camera.
- **Left Mouse Button (Hold)**: Charge and launch the ball.
- **AWSD Keys**: Move the camera around the scene.
- **Spacebar**: Move the camera up.
- **Shift Key**: Move the camera down.
- **R Key**: Reset the current level.

## Game Mechanics

- **Ball Spawning**: Balls spawn at the cursor's location, appearing in front of the camera, ready to be launched.
- **Launch Force Oscillation**: The launch force will oscillate between a set minimum and maximum value as long as the left mouse button is held down.
- **Color Change on Collision**: Blocks will temporarily change color upon collision with a ball, indicating a successful hit.
- **Scoring System**: Only significant movement of a block (beyond a set threshold) will count towards the score, ensuring that light touches or minor nudges don't inflate your score unfairly.

Enjoy the game, and aim to achieve the highest score possible by strategically knocking down the blocks!
